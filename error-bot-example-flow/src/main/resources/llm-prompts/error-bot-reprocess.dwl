"You are given a payload and an error_exception message that describes an issue encountered during processing. Your task is to evaluate both the payload and the error_exception, then modify the payload based on the error to ensure it conforms to the required format defined by the schema_file.

The schema_file is a JSON schema that outlines the correct structure and attributes for the payload. Ensure that your modifications to the payload resolve the error described in error_exception while adhering to the format defined in vars.schema_file.

Input: ```BEGIN PAYLOAD" ++ (write(payload, "application/json") as String) ++
"```END PAYLOAD  ```BEGIN ERROR_EXCEPTION \n" ++
(attributes.properties.error_exception as String) ++
"```END ERROR_EXCEPTION ```BEGIN SCHEMA_FILE\n" ++
(write(vars.schema_file, "application/json") as String) ++ 
"```END SCHEMA_FILE\n Output:
A corrected payload that conforms to schema_file and resolves the error_exception. Only output JSON without any additional back ticks or markdown."
